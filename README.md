One of my colleague sent me a corrupted excel document encoded with GB2312. My OS was in English, and the content was not readable after I opened the file. Since the file was in .xls format, I could not convert the file with Notepad++ directly. 

How to use it:

If you have same issue, you can save the xls file as csv with utf-8 encoding. The saved csv file is still not readable, then you can use my script to covert it to readable format.
